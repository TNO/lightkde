# lightkde

A lightning fast, lightweight, and reliable kernel density estimation.

* Easy to use, e.g. ``density_vec, x_vec = kde_1d(sample_vec=sample)``.
* Works with 1d and 2d samples.
* Works with weighted samples as well.
* Based on the MATLAB implementations of Botev: {cite}`botev_kde`, {cite}`botev_kde2d`.
