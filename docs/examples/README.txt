.. note::

    The examples are selected to show how to use ``lightkde`` and to illustrate some
    cases where it is advised to use it rather than a rule-of-thumb bandwidth
    selection based approach like ``scipy.stats.gaussian_kde``. For many cases, the
    rule-of-thumb bandwidth selection of ``scipy`` works well.
